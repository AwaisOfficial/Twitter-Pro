    <h5 class="mt-5">Your Content in our Services</h5>
    <p>
    Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give only VIPS's (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to only VIPS's Maps). Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    If you have a only VIPS's Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on only VIPS's or on third-party applications connected to your only VIPS's Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our Services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your only VIPS's Account. For example, you can choose your settings so your name and photo do not appear in an ad.
    </p>
   
    <p>
    You can find more information about how only VIPS's uses and stores content in the privacy policy or additional terms for particular Services. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.

    <h5>About Software in our Services</h5>
    <p>

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.
    </p>
    <p>

    We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.
    </p>
    
    <h5>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h5>
    <p>
    We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
    Other than as expressly set out in these terms or additional terms, neither only VIPS's nor its suppliers or distributors make any specific promises about the Services. For example, we don’t make any commitments about the content within the Services, the specific functions of the Services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs. We provide the Services “as is”.
    </p>
    <p>
    Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties.
    </p>
    
    <h5>Liability for our Services</h5>
    <p>
    When permitted by law, only VIPS's, and Google’s suppliers and distributors, will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.
    </p>
    <p>
    To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of only VIPS's, and its suppliers and distributors, for any claims under these terms, including for any implied warranties, is limited to the amount you paid us to use the Services (or, if we choose, to supplying you the Services again).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In all cases, only VIPS's, and its suppliers and distributors, will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    
    <h5>Business uses of our Services</h5>
    <p>
    If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify only VIPS's and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.
    </p>
    
    <h5>About these Terms</h5>
    <p>
    We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.
    
    If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.
    
    These terms control the relationship between only VIPS's and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.
    
    If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).
    
    If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
    
    The courts in some countries will not apply California law to some types of disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where California law is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, you agree that the laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s choice of law rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. Similarly, if the courts in your country will not permit you to consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A., then your local jurisdiction and venue will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and only VIPS's consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
